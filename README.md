# Problem We Are Solving

Natural disasters come in many forms. However one of the most devastating impact comes from Earthquakes that leads to staggering number of casualties and loss of natural resources, causing huge economic loss to a government. A by-product of this can also be Tsunami, Landslides and Liquefaction. In the past, all of these has led to loss of several thousands of lives and a catastrophic economic loss in billions of dollars till date.

# Why we are focussed on Earthquake

This report evaluates total disaster-related economic losses and fatalities between 1998 and 2017. The report finds that between 1998 and 2017, climate-related and geophysical disasters killed 1.3 million people and left a further 4.4 billion injured, homeless, displaced or in need of emergency assistance. While the majority of fatalities were due to geophysical events, mostly earthquakes and tsunamis , and other extreme weather events. In 1998-2017, disaster-hit countries experienced direct economic losses valued at US$ 2,908 billion, of which climate-related disasters caused US$ 2,245 billion or 77% of the total. This is up from 68% (US$ 895 billion) of losses (US$ 1,313 billion) reported between 1978 and 1997. Overall, reported losses from extreme weather events rose by 151% between these two 20-year periods.

# What we can do?

Based on the previous data we are able to identify MOST FREQUENT AREAS which are effected under earthquake. By identifying these areas we can alert the surrounding areas/localities and nearby people about the dangerous disasters that can happen. So as a result we can reduce economic loss,human catastrophes, livelihood and infrastructure which are in the earthquake prone zone

# Our Solution 

The team intends to design a simple but effective MODEL which takes the input of previous 100 years of earthquake data.
conducts analysis on  the earthquake pattern based on which it will find out the major earthquake prone areas..
 To implement this we have tried different data analytic algorithms and eventually ended up with one giving us the highest accuracy
